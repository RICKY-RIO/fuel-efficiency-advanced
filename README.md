# Fuel Efficiency Prediction Project üöó

This project predicts the fuel efficiency (MPG) of cars using machine learning models in Python. You can train the models, add new cars for prediction, and view results in your browser-all with simple scripts!

---

## Features

- **Train and evaluate models** (Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting)
- **Predict MPG for new cars** by adding them to a CSV file
- **View results in your browser** as a stylish table
- **Reusable saved models** for fast predictions

---

## How to Use

1. **Train the Models**

python fuel_efficiency_advanced.py

text
- Trains models and saves them as `.pkl` files.

2. **Add New Cars**
- Open `new_cars.csv` and add your new car details (one per row).

3. **Predict MPG for New Cars**

python predict_new_cars.py

text
- Generates `new_cars_with_predictions.csv` with predicted MPG.

4. **View Predictions in Your Browser**

python show_new_car_predictions.py

text
- Opens a table of predictions in your browser.
